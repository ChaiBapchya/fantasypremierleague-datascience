When u make a HTTP Request, if we read it using urllib
It treats the response as a String
Hence despite the format was in JSON, Errors like 
1. TypeError: string indices must be integers, not str
2. AttributeError str-object-has-no-attribute

Hence use other library that treats Request - Response as Json
