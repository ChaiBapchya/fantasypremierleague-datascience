While checking the source of any webpage - Directly Inspect element of Value visible on Webpage isnt always helpful

Thanks to http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/
Realization 
User(Client) Requests using Browser
Reaches the Server
Data can be fetched and injected into the Template and send as a Response back to the Client
i.e. Server side Page creation
OR
Client side Web App - 
Server sends the Static content HTML page
but Data -  Javascript in the server response fetches the data from an API and uses it to create the page client-side

To get such data - Developer tools - Network - XHR (instead of normal HTML )

#html_doc = urllib2.urlopen("https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/bootstrap-static").read()
#print(html_doc[1])

When u make a HTTP Request, if we read it using urllib
It treats the response as a String
Hence despite the format was in JSON, Errors like 
1. TypeError: string indices must be integers, not str
2. AttributeError str-object-has-no-attribute

Hence use other library that treats Request - Response as Json 


names.append(full_name.str())
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'str'

Solution - str(full_name)
